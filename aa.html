	Dear Agony Aunt,
	
	I need help urgently! I have been put in charge of Perdido Beach and elected as the mayor. I had people coming to me for help with everything from a stubbed toe to someone hurting their feelings.
	I feel so stressed out and don't know what to do. Everyone is treating me as if I'm their parents and telling me every little thing that has gone wrong.
	
	Please help,
	
	Sam Temple

	Dear Sam,
	
	I'm so sorry to hear of your problems. You should tell someone how you are feeling and get some help.
	Maybe make a rota so the stress is evenly shared. I hope my advice will help.
	
	Yours,
	
	Agony Aunt
