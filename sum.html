	Chapter One
	All the adults disappear. Then Sam, Astrid and Quinn go and check out Quinn's house. Quinn then has a breakdown when his parents aren't there.
	They then go and check their own houses. In the plaza there is a fire and Sam goes in and tries to save a child but fails and barely escapes.
	When other children came and asked what should they do Sam has no idea so his automatic response was go and eat a cookie.
	Then children from Coates Academy appear in a parade of cars.
